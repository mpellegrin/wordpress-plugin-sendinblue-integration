# Wordpres SendInBlue Campaigns integration
This plugin uses the SendInBlueâ„¢ API to create campaings from your Wordpress content.

Most notably, it integrates the events from [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) as blocks in created campaign.

Please note that **the [official SendInBlue plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailin/) is required for this plugin to work properly**

## Main features
 * Easy campaigns creation from the Wordpress interface, re-using the contents.
 * Two newsletter modes are supported:
   * Classic, retrieve content from post HTML
   * [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) integration, show the next days events as blocks in campaign

## Limitations
 * Only one theme is available for the newsletter, natively integrated in the plugin.
